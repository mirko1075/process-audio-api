# WebSocket Endpoint Documentation
# OpenAPI 3.x does not natively support WebSocket, so this is documented as an extension
x-websocket-streaming:
  path: /socket.io/
  namespace: /audio-stream
  protocol: Socket.IO
  description: |
    Real-time audio streaming endpoint for mobile applications using Socket.IO protocol.

    ## Connection
    Connect to the WebSocket with authentication:

    **JavaScript/TypeScript (React Native):**
    ```typescript
    import io from 'socket.io-client';

    const socket = io('http://localhost:5000/audio-stream', {
      transports: ['websocket'],
      auth: {
        token: 'your_auth0_jwt_token'
      }
    });
    ```

    **Authentication:**
    - ONLY Auth0 JWT tokens are accepted
    - Token must be obtained via Auth0 authentication flow
    - Pass token in `auth.token` parameter during connection
    - Connection will be rejected if token is invalid or expired

    ## Client to Server Events

    ### Event: audio_chunk
    Send audio data chunk for real-time transcription.

    **Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "audio_chunk": "BASE64_ENCODED_PCM_AUDIO_DATA",
      "timestamp": "2025-12-04T10:30:01.500Z"
    }
    ```

    **Audio Specifications:**
    - Encoding: Linear PCM (linear16)
    - Sample Rate: 16000 Hz
    - Channels: Mono (1 channel)
    - Bit Depth: 16 bit
    - Chunk Duration: 500ms - 1000ms recommended
    - Format: Raw PCM data encoded in Base64

    **TypeScript Example:**
    ```typescript
    socket.emit('audio_chunk', {

    });
    ```

    ### Event: stop_streaming

      "timestamp": "2025-12-04T10:30:00"
    }
    ```

    ### Event: transcription
    Received when transcription results are available (interim or final).

    **Payload:**
    ```json
    {

      "is_final": false,
      "timestamp": "2025-12-04T10:30:02",
      "confidence": 0.95
    }
    ```

    **Fields:**
    - `transcript` (string): Transcribed text
    - `is_final` (boolean): true for final transcription, false for interim results
    - `timestamp` (string): ISO 8601 timestamp
    - `confidence` (number): Confidence score (0.0 - 1.0)

    **TypeScript Example:**
    ```typescript
    socket.on('transcription', (data) => {
      if (data.is_final) {
        // Handle final transcription
        setFinalText(prev => prev + ' ' + data.transcript);
      } else {
        // Handle interim transcription (live preview)
        setInterimText(data.transcript);
      }
    });
    ```

    ### Event: streaming_stopped
    Received when streaming is successfully stopped.

    **Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Streaming stopped successfully",
      "timestamp": "2025-12-04T10:35:00"
    }
    ```

    ### Event: error
    Received when an error occurs during streaming.

    **Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Error processing audio data",
      "timestamp": "2025-12-04T10:30:05"
    }
    ```

    **Common Errors:**
    - "Connection not initialized": Audio sent before connection established
    - "Invalid audio data format": Audio not in valid Base64 format
    - "Error processing audio data": General processing error
    - "Transcription service error": Deepgram API error

    ## Complete Integration Flow

    1. **Authenticate via Auth0:**
       ```typescript
       // Obtain Auth0 JWT token via Auth0 authentication flow
       // (e.g., using Auth0 SDK or direct API calls)
       const auth0_jwt_token = await authenticateWithAuth0();
       ```

    2. **Connect WebSocket:**
       ```typescript
       const socket = io('http://localhost:5000/audio-stream', {
         auth: {token: auth0_jwt_token}
       });
       ```

    3. **Handle Events:**
       ```typescript
       socket.on('connected', () => console.log('Connected'));
       socket.on('transcription', handleTranscription);
       socket.on('error', handleError);
       ```

    4. **Start Recording & Streaming:**
       ```typescript
       // Record audio and send chunks
       setInterval(() => {
         const audioChunk = getAudioChunk(); // Your recording logic
         socket.emit('audio_chunk', {
           audio_chunk: audioChunk.toString('base64'),
           timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
         });
       }, 1000);
       ```

    5. **Stop Streaming:**
       ```typescript
       socket.emit('stop_streaming');
       ```

    6. **Disconnect:**
       ```typescript
       socket.disconnect();
       ```

    7. **Logout (optional):**
       ```typescript
       // Revoke JWT token
       await fetch('http://localhost:5000/auth/logout', {
         method: 'POST',
         headers: {
           'Authorization': `Bearer ${auth0_jwt_token}`
         }
       });
       ```

    ## Transcription Service Details

    - **Provider:** Deepgram Nova-2
    - **Language:** Italian (it) - configurable in backend
    - **Features:**
      - Smart formatting (punctuation, capitalization)
      - Interim results for live preview
      - High accuracy for conversational audio
      - Real-time streaming with low latency

    ## Best Practices

    1. **Audio Quality:**
       - Use device's best microphone
       - Record in quiet environment
       - Maintain consistent volume

    2. **Chunk Size:**
       - 500ms - 1000ms optimal for balance
       - Smaller chunks = lower latency, higher overhead
       - Larger chunks = higher latency, lower overhead

    3. **Error Handling:**
       - Always handle 'error' events
       - Implement reconnection logic
       - Validate token before connecting

    4. **Performance:**
       - Send audio chunks at consistent intervals
       - Don't buffer too much audio client-side
       - Monitor network connectivity

    5. **User Experience:**
       - Show interim results for immediate feedback
       - Display final results separately
       - Indicate connection status visually
